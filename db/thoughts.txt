Ben and Allison (and Olly)
Dearest Carrie and Truman,
 
In typical fashion, we didn't see your requests for letters until the day before your journey to the mountaintop. Needless to say I would have much rather written something by hand, but I think you will agree this is much more my style. 

Words cannot describe how happy we were when you guys told us you were getting married. Having known you both for so long, having known your stories, this is the perfect beginning to your next chapter. Many more adventures await, through many more trials, and many more triumphs.

It's a simple thing you are doing - affirming something you both already know. It's a simple act, with a bare minimum of two words to get the job done. But that simple act is chock full of meaning, filled to overflowing with love, of trust in each other, and commitment to something greater than the sum of its parts. 

I'm only saying all this gushy stuff to point out something else you both already know. This is something worth celebrating. This is one of the payoffs for the love you share, the commitment you have given each other. You've made it to the top of the mountain! I'm sure you can see the many other peaks you may climb someday, but for now, enjoy the view. Enjoy each other- this day is for you. 

With all the love we can muster, 

Ben and Allison

P.s. Dear Catballs,

Bark, Bark. Woof! 

Kindest Regards,
Olly

I've always valued and appreciated your friendship and I'm glad that you two will have each other to take care of, and love, each other and support each other. Your pictures are just the cutest and the ones from the ceremony just made me so happy I'm just lost for words. I miss you guys and I'm just so happy for you. Sorry I'm late to the party, really hoping you still see this! Hulk and Eevee say woof woof. <3 Have the greatest time and wishing you all the best.
