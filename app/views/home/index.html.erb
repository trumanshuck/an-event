      Catballs is still delighted -- mostly because he's once again within arm's reach to be pet on his small orange head.  We, however, are delighted to announce that we made it!  We travelled all of the way to Yosemite National Park and were married at sunrise on Inspriation Point on October 13th 2020.

      We saw some animals, many tall trees, and a couple of huge rocks. And now we've got more pictures so that you can see as well.  <%= link_to "Check it out!", "https://photos.carrie-truman.fyi", target: "_blank" %>

      The love you've shared with us is part of what makes us "us," and your support has made our trip possible. Thank you all for following along.
    </p>

    <p class="text-2xl md:text-4xl text-center font-heading">
      We look forward to celebrating with you someday.
